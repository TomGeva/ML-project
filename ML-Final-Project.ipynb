    "### **Simple Exploration Notebook - Sberbank**\n",
    "- **Price Transformation Logarithmic Form**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SRK (the author of these notebooks) made an observation on the distribution of price_doc and noticed that it is very right-skewed, so he decided to transform it, and later on model on the log-Price instead on the original price.\n",
    "- **Median Price Change Across Time**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SRK attempted to identify price changes over the different year & month combinations that are present in the data using a barplot of the median price in each year & month combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this graph there seem to be some relation, but further on in the second notebook it is clearer that this is not the case.\n",
    "- **Missing Values**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SRK uses a horizontal barplot to view the amounts of missing values in each column, and he finds that there is there some grouping effect over the missing values of diffeent columns, different columns have the same amount of missing values (seemingly atleast).\n",
    "- **Top 5 Highest Importance Features (HI Features)**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SRK finds the top 5 highest importance features, which are:\n",
    "    1. $full\\_sq \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\:\\, importance = 1677$\n",

    "- **Visual Relation of Top 5 HI Features With Price**\n",

    "    To better understand the relationships of these top 5 HI features, SRK creates several kinds of graphs to see and describe the interpertation of log-Price across the changing values of these features.\n",

    "    1. <u>full_sq:</u> \n",
    "    - ***[1D]Distribution-Scatter Joinplot*** of the log-Full_sq and log_Price, and there seem to be some linear relation expressed between them.\n",
    "    2. <u>life_sq:</u> \n",
    "    - ***[1D-2D]Distribution Joinplot*** of the log-Life_sq and log_Price, and it very noticeable that there are many values in log-Life_sq that equal to 0, and are practically separate from many other values, meaning many of life_sq values equal to 1 or close to 1, are there might be some error in these samples.\n",

    "- **Importing the Data with Additional Macro-Economic Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Not like in his previous notebook, in this notebook SRK imports the data and adds to the train dataset and the test dataset additional macro-economic features that are in the macro.csv file, this would expand his options in picking the features to model apon.\n",
    "- **Categorical Features Conversion - Label Encoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "    SRK converts the categorical features to numerical using label encoding to be able further on to test their importance and affect on the price.\n",
    "- **Missing Values Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "    SRK knows from his previous notebook that some behaviour is displayed across the missing values, so here he makes a new feature that represents the amount of missing values in each row, where potentially this could have an affect on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    right after that he fills all the missing values with -99, this value is highly unlikely, and due to the use of XGBoost and Random Forest models these values are very descernable by the trees, and further more, could be handled appropriately according to them being a missing value.\n",
    "- **Timestamp Derived Features**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The timestamp feature is of either character, datetime or (after some tranformation) int dtype, all 3 of these dont properly represent the full interpertation of the feature that could be important to the model, such as the year, year & month combination, month of the year, year & week combination, week of the year, day of the week and potentially many others,\n",
    "\n",
    "    SRK derives several features out of the timestamp feature and plots each of their relation with price, here it is clearer that they dont have any clear relation that is usefull to the model.\n",
    "- **Top 5 HI Features Derived Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "    According to the previous notebook top 5 HI features, SRK creates and tests some features that could be derived from these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - from full_sq and life_sq he tries to create some ratio features and difference features, all of which dont seem to be of any help.\n",
    "    - from floor and max_floor he tries as well to create some ration features and difference features, these he doesnt seem to particulary test in any visual way like previously.\n",
    "    - from build_year he creates a building age feature, also not tested.\n",
    "    - out of the timestamp features he created previously he creates supply & demand features that represent aproximatly how many apartments were available and were sold in a specific year & month/week combination\n",
    "    - further on he starts creating features that are generaly logical to take into acount when pricing an apartment, such as the ratio of children in school or preschool over the school and preschool quotas.\n",
    "- **Model Generation & Importance Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "    After all of this feature engineering, SRK made an XGBoost model using the XGBoost package with some preset hyper-parameters over all of the features he has in he's data and tested it over a validation dataset he created prior to that, this model has trained on the train dataset again and again untill its rmse results havent decreased significantly for 50 rounds, and right after that he ploted the importance of the top 50 features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    here we see that only full_sq and floor remained in the top 5 HI features, and that full_sq has a significantly high importance score compared to all other features, and he gives a warning that adding many variables will degrade the performance of the model."

    "## c. Critique and Improvements\n",
    "### **Simple Exploration Notebook - Sberbank**\n",
    "SRK gave a fairly detailed data exploration methodology and some vary compeling observations that helped him further on in the exploration and in his next notebook when he did the feature engineering and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "while he gave many observations that helped in the further process he made in his next notebook, he completely missed or ignored many observations about missing values, skewing values and illogical values that are present in the features, which are fairly important to the machine learning pre-processes as they are indications for needed actions at the data cleaning stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "all of these problematic values in the data are noticeble in hes exploration, and he only comments on tiny parts of them and does not handle them almost at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "without proper data cleaning prior to modeling, the resulting model will become worse and worse the 'dirtier' the data is, as there is more prominant noise for the model to catch and treat it as a behaviour represented in the data, thus becoming more and more off-course.\n",
    "\n",
    "skewing values are noticeble at:\n",
    "- log-Price's Distribution graph, where there are 2 relatively high spikes to the left of the distribution, which should potentially be considered outliers, and smoothed before modeling.\n",
    "- log-Life_sq's & log-Price's [1D-2D]Distribution graph, where in the left side of the distribution we see a high and unusual spike, which heavily skewes the distribution of log-Life_sq and life_sq as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "illogical values are noticeble at:\n",
    "- log-Full_sq's & log-Price's [1D]Distribution-Scatter graph, where we see among the dots groups of dots with the exact same log-Full_sq value or the exact same log-Price value, something that is highly unlikely to happen, especially to this sizes of groups that we can see are creating almost completely continuous lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "missing values are mentioned in its own graph but there is no observation made for the potential relationships the groups SRK mentions has and these relationships' affect on the model created later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Feature Engineering & Validation Strategy | Kaggle**\n",
    "SRK gave here as well fairly good examples, this time in the process of feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "the first noticeble (and in our eyes significant) difference, as mentioned in task 2.b., is the addition of the macro-economic features to the datasets to use them as important inforamtional features to create with other derived features.\n",
    "\n",
    "here SRK starts with setting the values of all the prices that are higher in their value than the 99th precentile value as that 99th precentile value, and aswell for the 1st precentile for the prices that are lower in value from it, we dont agree with doing so because it creates an abnormality that affects the modeling and makes it a tad-bit 'clearer' that there is there some significant behaviour that happens in these 1st and 99th precentiles that in actuality does not exist, such a behaviour now would be easier to catch for the trees in the model, while this behaviour has been manually manifactured.\n",
    "\n",
    "it would be better to decide whether to delete these samples or perform winsorization on them, instead of setting their value like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "right after this, he performs label encoding, which is needed here in our opinion, but we see an issue with the performance, there is no consideration for missing values, misspelled values or any other problematic value that could be in a categorical feature, instead we think there should be done some proper data cleaning (as mentioned over at the previous notebook) so the label encoding would not be compromised with its values.\n",
    "\n",
    "next there is a very creative, informative and inovative feature engineering in accordance to the different features and also with the amounts of missing values in a sample, after keeping such a feature SRK replaces all of the missing values with -99, this as some sort of a flag for the XGBoost or Random Forest models of a missing value, this should be possible for the models to recognise as explained over at the previous notebook, and is a great additional way to use the information that could come out from using missing values like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "further more, in the rest of this notebook SRK does not check and give any consideration for removing 'volatile' features which have over 50% (or other any other threashold) missing values, which should be taken care of before the start of the modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "for us one more thing is missing before modeling and seeing the importance levels of the features and that is some form of feature filtering, we believe that the use of a correlation matrix is needed here and according to it SRK should have filtered all but one chosen arbitrarily out of each group of highly correlated features, this way we decrease (pretty sure significantly) the features that act as 'noise catchers'."
